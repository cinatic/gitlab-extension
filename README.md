commits & pipelines.

### Setup
Either install it: 
- via EGS https://extensions.gnome.org/ 
- download a release: https://github.com/cinatic/gitlab-extension/releases

## Data Source
The data is fetched from the official GitLab API https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/. 
The API has some *limitions*, e.g. it only returns domain specific data. 
As an example `projects` and `commits` for example do not have any information of the pipeline status or you
can only fetch `pipelines` for a single project. So in this extension we mash up some data and can show only 
the pipeline information for the most recent projects to avoid hitting the 10 requests / s limit.

If you want to play with the API you might be interested in this postman collection --> https://github.com/cinatic/gitlab-postman-collection

## TODO

- caching
- lazy loading of additional data (like project pipeline status)
- detail view for commits
- detail view for pipeline w/ nice jobs visualization
- add pagination
- add setting to toggle public / private repositories
